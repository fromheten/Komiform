# Komiform
## A Better Way to do Dependencies

Komiform is a library for sharing code.

It has 2 functions of intrest - `publish!` and `get-form`.

* `publish!` takes a Clojure form and uploads it, giving you a hash of the form back. The hash is the globally unique ID of your form. No 2 forms can ever have the same ID. That is why hashes are better than names, for identification.

* `get-form` takes a hash and returns the form, evaluated. It keeps a local cache, so you only ever do one network request (much like Maven does in `~/.m2`).

## TL;DR
``` clojure
(require 'komiform.core :refer [get-form publish!])
(publish! '(fn add2 [n] (+ 2 n))) ;=> "KTewcBHxQ8GFaNQ96IHfp72YtTM7BY90YccmiaGka94"
(let [add2 @(komiform.core/get-form "KTewcBHxQ8GFaNQ96IHfp72YtTM7BY90YccmiaGka94")]
  (add2 5)) ;=> 7
```

## Installation

In `project.clj` or `build.boot`
```
[komiform "1.0.0"]
```

## What's in a name?
Like all great works of art, this library was written because I can up with a pun for the name. "Kom i form" means "get in shape" in Swedish, which I thought was funny because the library is about handling forms in a blazing fast way.

## Problems you no longer suffer
* Never again copy-paste code - not even when you are lazy
* Semver
* Having a bulky "shared" .jar for things different apps share

## Honourable mentions
* `justin_smith` @ freenode irc, for always being there and answering peoples questions. What a champion!
